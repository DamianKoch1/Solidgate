# Solidgate

Unreal, C++

Solidgate is a 3D first-person stealth game, set in a prison. The protagonist is an innocent prisoner who wants to escape and prove his innocence. Made as a student project in a 10 man team during my third semester at the S4G School for Games GmbH.

As one of 2 programmers, I was mostly responsible for AI programming and AI - related features such as hideouts for
the player, noises the guards react to and cameras that observe an area and alert guards,
but also bugfixing and technical documentation.
